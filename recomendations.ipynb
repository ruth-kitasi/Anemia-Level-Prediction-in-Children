    "To add tailored recommendations based on the anemia level prediction, you can create a post-processing function in your app that takes the model’s output and generates the appropriate recommendations. Here’s a step-by-step approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a Recommendation Function\n",
    "Define a function that takes the anemia prediction as input and outputs the corresponding recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_recommendation(anemia_level):\n",
    "    recommendations = {\n",
    "        \"non_anemic\": \"Maintain a balanced diet rich in iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid. Consider regular checkups if you're at risk.\",\n",
    "        \"mild\": \"Increase iron-rich foods like spinach, red meat, and lentils. Consider iron supplements if needed, after consulting a healthcare provider.\",\n",
    "        \"moderate\": \"Increase iron intake, and consult a healthcare provider to discuss possible iron or vitamin supplementation.\",\n",
    "        \"severe\": \"Seek immediate medical consultation to identify the underlying cause and discuss treatment options like supplements or other interventions.\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return recommendations.get(anemia_level, \"No specific recommendation available.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Integrate Recommendation Logic into the Web App\n",
    "After your model makes a prediction, pass the output to the `get_recommendation` function to generate the recommendation text. Here’s how you might structure it in your app code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example pseudocode for app workflow\n",
    "def predict_and_recommend(user_input):\n",
    "    # Step 1: Use the model to predict anemia level\n",
    "    anemia_level = model.predict(user_input)  # Replace with actual prediction code\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Step 2: Generate recommendation based on predicted anemia level\n",
    "    recommendation = get_recommendation(anemia_level)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Step 3: Return or display the prediction and recommendation\n",
    "    return anemia_level, recommendation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Display Recommendation in the Web Interface\n",
    "On the front end, modify your form’s submission handler to display both the anemia prediction and recommendation. Here’s a simple example if you’re using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the front end:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flask Route\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    user_input = request.form  # Collect input from form\n",
    "    anemia_level, recommendation = predict_and_recommend(user_input)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return render_template('results.html', anemia_level=anemia_level, recommendation=recommendation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTML Template (results.html)\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <title>Anemia Prediction Results</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <h1>Anemia Prediction</h1>\n",
    "    <p>Your anemia level: {{ anemia_level }}</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Recommendation</h2>\n",
    "    <p>{{ recommendation }}</p>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Test the Workflow\n",
    "With this setup, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Enter socio-economic factors.\n",
    "2. Receive a prediction.\n",
    "3. See a tailored recommendation based on the anemia level directly on the results page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, users get actionable advice immediately based on the model’s prediction. Let me know if you’d like further customization ideas or have questions about specific frameworks!"
