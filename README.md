## 1.0 BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
### Overview
Anemia is a significant health issue, especially among Nigerian children under the age of five This condition hampers their growth, cognitive development, and immune health, driven primarily by poor nutrition, frequent infections, and limited healthcare access.
Socioeconomic factors, such as low household income, limited education, and lack of proper sanitation, further contribute to its high prevalence. Tackling anemia is essential, not only to improve children’s health outcomes but also for Nigeria's broader national development, given the long-term impacts on physical and cognitive well-being.

## Problem Statement
![problem_statment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c999d5a6-4bb1-4f40-a26c-070fd37035e8)

Many children in Nigeria suffer from undetected and
untreated anemia due to limited healthcare access, high
diagnostic costs, and low public awareness.
This project aims to develop a model that predicts anemia
severity based on socioeconomic factors, enabling the
identification of high-risk children and supporting targeted
health interventions..

## Objectives

1. Develop a classification model for Anemia severity in children

2. Identify key socioeconomic determinants influencing Anemia severity 

3. Evaluate the model’s predictive accuracy for effective Public Health Use

4. Provide Actionable Insights for Targeted Interventions
5. Support Long-Term Policy Development for Anemia Reduction

## Model Implementation
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees.
- Random Forest
- KNN
## Evaluation
The project's success was measured through:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score
- Confusion Matrices

### Findings
- Children in the Rural areas experience higher Anemia level than those living in urban areas due to limited acess to proper healthcare and sanitation.

- Analysis of socio-economic determinants reveals that factors such as wealth index and parental education significantly influence anemia severity.

- Different levels of Anemia are a result of the different hemoglobin levels. Chilren with lower hemoglobin level have higher level of Anemia and the reverse it true. 

## Conclusions:
1. The project successfully developed a classification model using Python libraries that predicts anemia severity among children below 5 years.


2. The model achieved high predictive accuracy, validated through rigorous testing metrics, affirming its readiness for real-world application.

3. The project's findings and the model’s application in real-world settings contribute to policy development by offering reliable data that highlight social economic factors associated with anemia. 

4. A user-friendly web application was developed as the project’s end-user interface. This application allows users to input data, leveraging the pickled model to make predictions and offer tailored recommendations.
