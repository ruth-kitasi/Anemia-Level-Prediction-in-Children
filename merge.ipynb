    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project aims to build a web application for predicting anemia levels in children. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to input relevant data and receive predictions along with tailored recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Pickle the encoder, pipeline and model**\n",
    "- The Random Forest Model was trained and pickled together with the encoder object and the preprocessing pipeline to ensure it could be easily loaded for predictions within the web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Download Dependencies**\n",
    "- Flask was installed as the web framework to build the web application, allowing for the creation of routes, handling of form data, and serving of HTML templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Organize Project Folder**\n",
    "- The project directory was structured to maintain organization and clarity. The setup included creating separate directories for the Flask app, the pickled model, HTML templates, CSS styles, and image assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Structure Overview\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Anemia-Level-Prediction-in-Children/\n",
    "     ├── app.py             # Flask app\n",
    "     ├── anemia_model.pkl   # Pickled pipeline, encoder and model\n",
    "     ├── templates/\n",
    "     │   ├── index.html     # HTML template for home page\n",
    "     │   ├── general_info.html  # HTML template for general information page\n",
    "     │   ├── factors.html   # HTML template for EDA insights\n",
    "     │   ├── prediction.html  # HTML template for prediction form\n",
    "     │   └── result.html    # HTML template for result page\n",
    "     └── static/\n",
    "         ├── css/\n",
    "         │   └── styles.css # CSS styles\n",

    "             └── anemic_child.jpg # Image file\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Set Up the Flask App**\n",
    "- In `app.py`, the Flask application was set up to manage routes, handle form data, and load the machine learning model for predictions. The main routes were defined as follows:\n",
    "  - **Home Route (`/`)**: This route renders the `index.html` template, which welcomes users and acts as the homepage.\n",
    "  - **General Information Route (`/general_info`)**: This route loads the `general_info.html` template, providing background information on anemia.\n",
    "  - **Factors Route (`/factors`)**: This route renders the `factors.html` template, displaying key insights and visualizations from the exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "  - **Prediction Route (`/predict`)**: This route processes the user input data, makes predictions with the model, and displays the results on `prediction.html` alongside tailored recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Create HTML Templates**\n",
    "- In the `templates/` directory, several HTML files were set up to create different pages for the web application:\n",
    "  - **`index.html`**: This home page welcomes users and provides a form for entering relevant features such as age and hemoglobin level.\n",
    "  - **`general_info.html`**: This page provides educational content and general information about anemia.\n",
    "  - **`factors.html`**: This page displays various insights and visualizations from the EDA phase.\n",
    "  - **`prediction.html`**: This page contains a form where users can input details required for prediction.\n",
    "  - **`result.html`**: This page displays the anemia prediction result based on user input along with tailored recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Design the User Interface (UI)**\n",
    "- Using CSS, HTML elements were styled to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. Specific attention was given to layout, typography, and images to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `static/css/styles.css`, styling for layout, typography, and images was added to improve the visual appeal of the application:\n",
    "  - **Background and Header Images**: `background.jpg` and `anemic_child.jpg` were integrated as background images for the body and header sections, respectively.\n",
    "  - **Styling**: Flexbox was used for the layout structure. Buttons were made interactive, and hover effects were added to buttons and links to provide a professional and engaging look.\n"
