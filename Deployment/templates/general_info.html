            <h2>Anemia in Children: A Global Health Concern</h2>
            <p>Anemia is a major public health concern globally, and its effects are especially pronounced among children under five, where it poses risks to growth, cognitive development, and immune health. Defined as a condition characterized by lower-than-normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels, anemia limits oxygen transport in the blood, which can lead to significant health complications. The World Health Organization estimates that 42% of children worldwide in this age group are anemic, predominantly due to iron deficiency, poor diet, and infections. Anemia in young children can lead to developmental delays, weakened immunity, and long-term health issues if left untreated. Socioeconomic factors, including access to quality food and healthcare, play a significant role in these high rates, with the most severe impacts observed in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

            <h2>Anemia in Africa</h2>
            <p>The African continent bears a disproportionate burden of anemia among children, with an estimated 60-80% prevalence in children under five. Causes include malnutrition, high prevalence of infectious diseases (like malaria and hookworm), and poor maternal health. Socioeconomic factors such as poverty, lack of healthcare, and limited access to nutritious food exacerbate the condition. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, faces a high prevalence due to ongoing challenges with food security, healthcare infrastructure, and education around health practices.</p>

            <h2>Anemia in Nigeria: A Critical Challenge</h2>
            <p>Nigeria represents one of the highest anemia burdens in Africa, with an estimated 68% of children under five affected. Factors contributing to anemia in Nigerian children include limited access to nutritious foods, recurrent infections, and inadequate healthcare, especially in rural and low-income areas. Socioeconomic determinants, such as low household income, education levels, and lack of access to clean water, also contribute to anemia's prevalence among Nigerian children, impacting their physical and cognitive development. Addressing anemia in Nigeria is essential, given its long-term effects on individual health and its broader implications for national development.</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Early Detection and Intervention</h2>
            <p>Childhood anemia is a critical public health issue, <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/prevalence-of-anaemia-in-children-under-5-years-(-)">World Health Organization</a>, leading to adverse impacts on cognitive and physical development, educational attainment, and overall quality of life. Despite its prevalence, anemia in Nigerian children often goes undiagnosed and untreated due to limited healthcare access, high diagnostic costs, and a lack of awareness about the condition (<a href="https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/reports/childhood-anemia-report">UNICEF, 2021</a>). This situation calls for innovative, accessible approaches to early diagnosis and intervention to reduce the burden of anemia and improve the health outcomes of vulnerable children across Nigeria.</p>

            <h2>Project Goal: Anemia Severity Prediction Model</h2>
            <p>This project seeks to address this gap by developing a classification model to predict the severity of anemia in Nigerian children up to 59 months old. The model will analyze key socioeconomic indicators to determine which factors most significantly contribute to the risk and severity of anemia in this vulnerable population. By identifying these primary contributors, the model aims to empower healthcare professionals, public health organizations, and policymakers with actionable insights. The ultimate goal is to enable more targeted and effective interventions that address the socioeconomic roots of anemia.</p>
