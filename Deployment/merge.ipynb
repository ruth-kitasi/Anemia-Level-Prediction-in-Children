    "# MODEL DEPLOYMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project aims to build a web application for predicting anemia levels in children. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to input relevant data and receive predictions along with tailored recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Pickle the encoder, pipeline and model**\n",
    "- The Random Forest Model was trained and pickled together with the encoder object and the preprocessing pipeline to ensure it could be easily loaded for predictions within the web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Download Dependencies**\n",
    "- Flask was installed as the web framework to build the web application, allowing for the creation of routes, handling of form data, and serving of HTML templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Organize Project Folder**\n",
    "- The project directory was structured to maintain organization and clarity. The setup included creating separate directories for the Flask app, the pickled model, HTML templates, CSS styles, and image assets.\n",
    "- **PostgreSQL** and **SQLAlchemy** were added to handle the storage of prediction results in a relational database.\n",
    "    - **`psycopg2`**: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.\n",
    "    - **`Flask-SQLAlchemy`**: Extension for integrating SQLAlchemy with Flask to interact with the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **Set Up the Flask App**\n",
    "The Flask app (`app.py`) contains routes to manage the different pages and features:\n",
    "- **Home (`/`)**: Displays the `index.html` template, which includes a welcome message and a brief description of the project.\n",
    "- **General Info (`/general_info`)**: Renders the `general_info.html` page with educational content about anemia, its causes, and prevention.\n",
    "- **Factors (`/factors`)**: Displays the `factors.html` template, which shows key insights and visualizations from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase.\n",
    "- **Prediction (`/predict`)**: Accepts user input, makes a prediction using the pre-trained model, and displays the results on the `prediction.html` and `result.html` pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Create HTML Templates**\n",
    "The `templates/` folder includes several key HTML files:\n",
    "- **`index.html`**: The homepage that greets the user and includes a form for entering the required details to predict anemia levels.\n",
    "- **`general_info.html`**: Provides educational information about anemia, its symptoms, and prevention strategies.\n",
    "- **`factors.html`**: Displays various visual insights from the EDA phase, such as the relationship between anemia levels and factors like age, education, and area type.\n",
    "- **`prediction.html`**: Contains the form where users enter their details for prediction.\n",
    "- **`result.html`**: Displays the prediction result and provides personalized recommendations based on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **UI Design**\n",
    "The user interface is styled using CSS in `static/css/styles.css`:\n",
    "- **Background and Header Images**: The visual design is enhanced with `background.jpg` as the page background and `anemic_child.jpg` as the header image.\n",
    "- **Layout and Styling**: Flexbox is used to ensure a responsive layout. Buttons and links have interactive hover effects for better user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Include EDA Insights with Images**\n",
    "The `factors.html` template displays several EDA visualizations:\n",
    "- **Anemia Level vs Age Group**: The distribution of anemia levels across different age groups of children, shown in `anemia-level_vs-age-group.png`.\n",
    "- **Anemia Level vs Area Type**: A comparison of anemia levels between urban and rural areas, shown in `anemia-level_vs-area-type.png`.\n",
    "- **Anemia Level vs Education Level**: The correlation between parents' education level and children's anemia severity, shown in `anemia-level_vs-education-level.png`.\n",
    "- **Distribution of Hemoglobin Levels**: The spread of hemoglobin levels among the children, shown in `Distribution-Hemoglobin-level.png`.\n",
    "- **Mother's Age at First Birth**: A distribution plot showing the age at which mothers had their first child, shown in `Distribution-Age-at-first-birth.png`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These images are stored in `static/images/` and provide critical insights into the factors influencing anemia prevalence in children.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Integrate PostgreSQL for Saving Predictions**\n",
    "To persist predictions, the following steps were performed:\n",
    "- **SQLAlchemy Setup**: \n",
    "    - `Flask-SQLAlchemy` was configured to connect the Flask app with the PostgreSQL database hosted on Render.\n",
    "    - The PostgreSQL database connection URI was stored in the app's configuration file using `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`.\n",
    "    - SQLAlchemy’s ORM was used to define the structure of the `Predictions` table.\n",
    "- **Prediction Model**: The prediction results, along with the user inputs, were saved into a `predictions` table in the PostgreSQL database.\n",
