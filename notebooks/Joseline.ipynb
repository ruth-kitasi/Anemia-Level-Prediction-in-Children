    "## PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Anemia is a widespread health challenge across Africa, particularly affecting young children and impeding their development, immunity, and long-term health outcomes. Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the world’s highest rates of childhood anemia due to factors like nutritional deficiencies, poverty, and limited access to healthcare. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Nigeria, the largest economy and most populous country in Africa, anemia affects approximately 68.9% of children under five. This study aims to explore the sociodemographic and maternal factors contributing to anemia prevalence among Nigerian children aged 6–59 months, with the goal of identifying critical areas for intervention and support.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Determine the prevalence of anemia in Nigerian children aged 6–59 months using data from the Demographic Health Survey.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Identify sociodemographic factors associated with anemia in young children, including maternal education, family income, and household size.\n",
